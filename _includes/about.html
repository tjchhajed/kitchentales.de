                I saw Shuro in the lectures at the university. I always thought of him as a handsome gentleman, too intelligent for me. My admiration for Shuro rose when I saw him playing the piano in the canteen. We exchanged short glances, with a desire to see again. We did not have to wait very long because to our surprise we met in the same German language class where our eyes could meet often because we used to sit opposite to each other. But it felt to me that Shuro never returned me smiles. He was rather ignoring me. Then I decided to unfriend him from my Facebook! But he got lucky because soon we actually ‘met’ and ‘talked’ for the first time in Chemnitz city fest with other friends. I realised that Shuro was trying hard to take his eyes off me. Well this confirmed that he felt for me but he was too proud to admit it.

              I saw Teju on day 1 at university. It was the love at first sight for me, however I was too careful to hide it from her knowledge. But Shuro was the shy guy - he could never even look into her eyes! He followed her into the tram, the city centre and the university! But took care that she never saw him. God forbid he was spying on her for love, but did not intend to talk too her! He took Teju for his wife, but only he and his closest friend Mishu knew about it. They was no way that our guy could get the girl he has taken for his wife until he at least spoke to her! Even he himself acknowledges -“Teju was the bubbly girl who got them into a conversation! He would just stealthily observer her!”
